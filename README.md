# SubliminalTests

A collection of software experiments to test effectiveness of various kinds of subliminals. 

Uses GNU 3.0 lincense. 

Presently there is 1 subliminal experiment in this repository made with HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It is still a work in progress.

The file titled "ColorSubliminalTest.html" displays a random 4 digit number with a color similar to, but not same as background. Presently it falls short of 2 requirements from it being able to test effectiveness of this type of subliminal.

Explation for ColorSubliminal Test: It has been sepeculated that humans can perceive millions of colors, these can be used to make subliminal messages. As it is difficult for a normal human to distinguish between two similar shades of same color, this slight difference between shades of a color can be used to make subliminal messages, which may not be perceived consciously but the subconscious and unconscious might register them. This clandestine form of manipulation deserves to made known to the entire public and safe guards against it must be put in place. 

United Nations has classified subliminals which it also refers to as "perception without awareness" as a major threat to human rights. 

When people hear the word subliminal, most would think of messages being flashed for short duration. This is one kind of subliminal. There are two other kinds of subliminals which deserve to be publicized as well. These are:

1. Sublimianls made with slight color variation to blend with the background. 
2. Subliminals made by changing the opacity of the message to blend with the background. 

Both of these types of subliminals can persist on every frame and might be indistinguishable from what is being seen, but might be registered by the subconscious. It is to test these types of theories of making subliminal messages that this GitHub repository has been created. I feel only by bringing this to light can others be innoculated against it.

If you have the skills necessary to make these kind of subliminal tests, you are welcome to join this and contribute to it.

Presently the tests are confined to HTML, JavaScript and CSS but if can port these experiments in C, C++, C#, Python, Java, LUA, etc you are also welcome to join this project.
